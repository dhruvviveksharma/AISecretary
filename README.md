# AI Secretary  

An **AI-powered productivity assistant** designed to help students (and busy people in general) manage time, organize notes, track tasks, and interact seamlessly with their calendar.  

This project is an ongoing attempt to combine **note-taking, task management, and scheduling** with the power of AI and popular productivity tools like **Google Calendar** and **Todoist**.
